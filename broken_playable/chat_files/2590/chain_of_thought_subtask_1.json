Add a visual timer UI element that displays the 15-second countdown for each turn - pending\n2. Implement the timer logic to end player's turn when time runs out - pending\n\n</general_task_context>\nThis is the specific task i need you to work on and implement:\n<current_task_you_need_to_work_on>\nYou are currently working on subtask 1/2:<subtask>Add a visual timer UI element that displays the 15-second countdown for each turn</subtask>\nPlease implement this subtask, considering the overall task and previous subtasks.\n</current_task_you_need_to_work_on>\n\n\n\n<**Playable general description**>\nbackgammon game with 3d dices but 2d scene, player vs player\n<**/Playable general description**>\n\n<**Important coding implementation for you (aider)**>\nInstructions for asset-related tasks:\n\n1. **File Path Replacement**: For asset replacement tasks (e.g., images, text, JSON, audio) that can be resolved by changing a file path in the code, simply replace the file path. Avoid changing variable names or other code elements that might cause errors in other files.\n\n2. **Use Placeholders for New Assets**: In your task, when adding or replacing assets, use placeholders for the needed assets. For example, if you need to use a new background image, update the code to reference the placeholder file path (e.g., 'assets/images/new_background.png'), even if the file doesn't exist yet. Assume that I will create and place the asset in the correct location after you are done.\n\n3. **Maintain Directory Structure**: Always use appropriate file paths that reflect the project's directory structure when specifying placeholders. For example, if the 'assets/audios' folder exists, use 'assets/audios/new_music.mp3' instead of just 'new_music.mp3'.\n\n4. **Avoid 'null' as Placeholder**: Never use 'null' as a placeholder. Always use a file path string as a placeholder for assets.\n\n5. It's OK if the new asset you added in code doesn't exist when you 'ls path/to/new_asset.png'. after you will finish I will add that task. you can finish working, don't rollback to the original file cause the new doesn't exist\n\n5. DONT EVER offer new task or somthing to add to the task, ONLY DO WHAT YOU ARE TOLD AND THAT'S IT. dont implement other stuff, dont ask for new ideas\n\n<**/Important coding implementation for you (aider)**>\n        </original_input_coder_got>\n\n        <git_diff_following_coder_changes>\n        diff --git a/playable/components/UITimer.ts b/playable/components/UITimer.ts\nnew file mode 100644\nindex 0000000..00b5f5f\n--- /dev/null\n+++ b/playable/components/UITimer.ts\n@@ -0,0 +1,80 @@\n+import { Container, Text, Graphics } from 'pixi.js';\n+import { MonoBehavior } from 'components/classes/monoBehavior';\n+import { Game } from 'components/classes/game';\n+import { Constants } from '../constants';\n+\n+export class UITimer extends MonoBehavior {\n+    private container: Container;\n+    private timerText: Text;\n+    private timerBg: Graphics;\n+    private timeLeft: number;\n+    private onTimeUp: () => void;\n+\n+    constructor(onTimeUp: () => void) {\n+        super();\n+        this.onTimeUp = onTimeUp;\n+        this.container = new Container();\n+        \n+        // Create background\n+        this.timerBg = new Graphics();\n+        this.timerBg.beginFill(0x000000, 0.5);\n+        this.timerBg.drawRoundedRect(0, 0, 80, 40, 10);\n+        this.timerBg.endFill();\n+        \n+        // Create timer text\n+        this.timerText = new Text('15', {\n+            fontFamily: 'Arial',\n+            fontSize: 24,\n+            fill: 0xFFFFFF,\n+            align: 'center'\n+        });\n+        this.timerText.anchor.set(0.5);\n+        this.timerText.position.set(40, 20);\n+        \n+        this.container.addChild(this.timerBg);\n+        this.container.addChild(this.timerText);\n+        \n+        // Position the timer in the top-right corner\n+        this.container.position.set(\n+            Game.getSceneSize().x - 100,\n+            20\n+        );\n+        \n+        Game.addToScene(this.container);\n+        this.hide();\n+    }\n+\n+    startTimer() {\n+        this.timeLeft = Constants.turnTimeLimit;\n+        this.updateTimerText();\n+        this.show();\n+        this.update();\n+    }\n+\n+    stopTimer() {\n+        this.hide();\n+    }\n+\n+    private updateTimerText() {\n+        this.timerText.text = Math.ceil(this.timeLeft).toString();\n+    }\n+\n+    show() {\n+        this.container.visible = true;\n+    }\n+\n+    hide() {\n+        this.container.visible = false;\n+    }\n+\n+    update(): void {\n+        if (this.container.visible && this.timeLeft > 0) {\n+            this.timeLeft -= Game.deltaTime;\n+            this.updateTimerText();\n+            \n+            if (this.timeLeft <= 0) {\n+                this.onTimeUp();\n+            }\n+        }\n+    }\n+}\ndiff --git a/playable/constants.ts b/playable/constants.ts\nindex 5b5d736..733a527 100644\n--- a/playable/constants.ts\n+++ b/playable/constants.ts\n@@ -8,4 +8,5 @@ export class Constants {\n     static readonly boardSize = { x: 900, y: 759 };\n     static readonly boardPointsCount = 24;\n     static readonly checkerSize = 128;\n+    static readonly turnTimeLimit = 15;

The implementation is clean, follows the game's architecture, and meets the requirements.\n\nThe next steps would be to proceed with the second subtask: implementing the full timer logic to end the player's turn when time runs out. The current implementation already has the groundwork laid out with the `onTimerExpired()` method in the `PlayableLevel` class.\n\nRecommendations for the next subtask:\n1. Ensure the timer works consistently across different game states\n2. Test the timer's interaction with other game mechanics\n3. Verify that the turn switching works correctly when the timer expires\n\nWould you like me to provide more detailed guidance on the next subtask?",
